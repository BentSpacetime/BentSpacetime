- 👋 Hi, I’m @BentSpacetime
- 👀 I’m interested in filling out README files, because, why not?  I have *all the time in the world*.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a roller coaster, doesn't have to be Twisted Colossus or Tatsu or even X2.  I can even collaborate on a water ride.
- 📫 How to reach me...? Just reach out and shake my hand!  Or if we have use technology, email also works.  I check social media about twice a year, so there may be significant latency if you try that.
